# summerproject
for MSU use!

The programs in this repository are the deliverables of my work at my summer 2019 internship at Montclair State University,
during which I was able to work with the O'Neil Research Group and assist in the data analysis portion of their study of 
Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics on Glassy Carbon and Silicon. 

The impact_analysis.py file contains the final program that plots current vs. time data for Pt nanoparticle impacts on the
glassy carbon or silicon electrodes. I utilized the peakutils library in order to identify statistically significant peaks 
in the data and visually present that data to the user. I used libraries such as numpy and pandas in order to integrate under
the curve using the trapezoidal rule so that charge and rate of reaction can be ultimately calculated. 

I look forward to continue to expand my Python skills so I can make this program even better! 

Enjoy,
Maria
